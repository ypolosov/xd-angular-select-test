# Sample plugin for Adobe XD using Angular

## Build

Before build don't forget to install packages using.

```
npm i
```

And to build the plugin run following command in the root folder:

```
npm run build -- --prod --extra-webpack-config webpack.extra.js --output-hashing=none
```

You will get output in the `dist` folder. Specifically you will see 3 folders inside:

-   `artifacts` contains ready to install plugin with \*.xdx extension
-   `package` contains compiled plugin source code. Really xdx is just zipped `package` folder. It contains of compiled angular part plus XD entrypoints and metadata. You can find more details about it on [Adobe XD Platform Develop guide](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/develop.html)
-   `sample-plugin` (folder name might be different) contains compiled angular code.
